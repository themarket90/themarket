TheMarket is a fully distributed, free to use marketplace for digital content. Our platform is based on Blockchain and IPFS. No servers are needed, no private users information, everything is distributed.

We believe that TheMarket is currently the only digital content distribution platform in the world with its unique features, which is based on three leading-edge technologies of Blockchain, Point-To-Point encryption algorithm and Distributed storage system.

To sell and buy contet you need ODC ( Original Digital Content ) which you can easily obtain from our automatic mining feature. All you have to do is open the platform and let it run, you can see the coins growing.

### Automatic ODC mining
Mining ODC's is as easy as opening the app and it will automatically start mining, so you can easilly start using our platform without need to pay anything.
