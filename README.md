The Technical Features/技术特征

What can we do/可以做什么？

The Market supports anonymous and encrypted distribution of almost all mainstream digital contents, including music, video profiles, images and articles. Just expand your imagination and The Market can help you to achieve!

The Market支持几乎所有主流数字内容，包括音乐、影像资料、图片、文章的匿名发布以及加密分发。充分发挥你的想象力，你能想到的事情The Market都能帮你实现！
Easy to Install and Use/安装、使用便捷

The Market client supports MacOS, Windows, Linux and other mainstream operating systems, which will be distributed in the form of a one-click executable package. Users only need to download, install and run. Humanized user-friendly UI design and mature technology shall greatly comfort the experience of non-tech-background users. At the meantime, after the officially launch of our Smart contracts and Block chain online, the UI features and user experiences can still be enhanced through client upgrade. 

The Market支持MacOS、Windows、Linux等主流操作系统，以安装包的形式分发，用户只需下载、安装、运行即可，人性化的UI设计充分考虑技术小白用户的使用场景，同时，在智能合约和区块链上线固化后，未来还是可以通过客户端的升级来不断提升用户体验。
Security and Anonymous/安全、全网匿名

This is extremely important! Your only exposure to The Market is your wallet address, which is a random combination of long Numbers and alphabet letters. Does this sound comfortable to you? All transactions, including digital contents, digital currency flow and instant communications are peer-to-peer encrypted and cannot be intercepted! Besides, no one can trace nor to find you unless you intentionally reveal who you are in the content you posted! Remember Mr., Satoshi Nakamoto? Can you find him?

这很重要！你在The Market上的唯一特征就是你的钱包地址，这是一串长长的数字+字母的随机组合。这样是不是听起来很舒服？所有的交易以及及时通信都是端到端加密的，无法被截获！除此之外，除非你有意在你发布的内容中有意透露你是谁，没有人可以找到你！还记得谁也找不到中本聪吗？
No Servers Needed at All/不需要任何服务器

Due to the amazing nature factor of Block chain technology, there is absolutely no servers need to maintain the existence of The Market network, all the data are stored in the Distributed storage system and no parties can breakdown the network once it’s online. Please don’t forget that even BitTorrent or Magnet URL technologies still deadly rely on BT Tracker Servers to work. Once the servers are closed or breakdown, there’s no chance to share anymore.

鉴于区块链技术的神奇本源，The Market的运行根本无需服务器的支持，所有的数据都存储在区块链上以及分布式存储系统中，只要系统上线，任何人都没有办法关闭掉它。请不要忘记了即使是目前非常流行的BT下载技术以及磁力链技术都是严重依赖于BT种子解析服务器的，只要服务器被关闭或者破坏，这样的下载分享将难以为继。

Peer-to-Peer Encryption, Protect the IP of Its Creator/端对端加密、保护作者的权益

After the creator published the content, if the purchaser submits a purchasing demand, the creator's client encrypts the contents of his/her creation through the public key at the creator's end, and such encryption process can only be decrypted at the purchaser’s client side with his/her own private key. In such a scenario, no one on the Internet can intercept and crack the content distributed by creator. 
(wow! Huge space for you to image for what you can do with it!)

发布者在发布内容后，如果购买者提交了购买需求，则由发布者的客户端在发布端通过公钥对文件内容加密，而这样的加密过程是仅限购买者通过自己的私钥，在自己的客户端才能解开的。在这样的情景下，全网无人能够截获并破解发布者分发的内容。（哇！巨大的想象空间）

Distributed File Storage System/分布式文件存储系统

Yes, digital contents that you distributed, are held in not only your own client, but also by all those holders that have made the purchase, which are as well selflessly shared in the whole Block chain. This can greatly accelerate the pace of content distribution. Meanwhile, as each and every one participate in the sharing chain is only providing a very small portion of the content,  each of them can only have very limited access to the original file, and hence the non-paid people shall never have access to the contents.

是的，你发布的内容，除了在你的本地电脑上，还被所有购买过你内容的人无私的分享在整个链上，这样的做法极大的加快了内容分发的速度，同时由于每个参与分享的人都只是贡献很小的一部分内容，所以，没有付费的人是永远都得不到的。

Nobody can Replicate Your Contents/无人可以复制保存并二次分发

The content you purchased can only be played or viewed by you and with your client. We don’t support to copy&save the contents and disseminate it future. But, as long as you have your client installed, the purchased contents will always belong to you and can be viewed at anytime!

你购买的内容，只能由你本人以及你的客户端打开播放或者浏览，我们不支持你把内容复制出来另行保存以及传播。但是，只要是你购买过的内容，将永远属于你！
Protect Your Original Creation/保护你的原创

First of all, any content released on The Market is unique, and Block chain based computing technology directly rejects such duplications if someone tries to re-publish documents that is already in The Market. Should you find you creation or publication is re-published with minor changes being made to the file, you can call on a vote and invite other people on the platform to anonymously vote to judge and decide the original copyright. After the closure of the vote, the copycat content will be automatically blocked by the system, at the same time, after the blockage, all purchase requests towards your content will be automatically re-directed to the address of your wallet.

首先，所有在The Market上发布的内容都是独一无二的，如果有人试图发布和平台上已有的内容重复的文件时，基于区块链的计算技术会直接拒绝这样的重复发布。如果你发现你创造并发布的内容被人在做了微小的改动后再次发布，你可以发起投票，请广大匿名用户共同评判并决定你的原属版权，在投票结束后，抄袭者发布的内容会被系统屏蔽掉，同时在此之后所有针对你发布内容的购买请求会自动转到你的钱包地址。

Mining at Your Client/终端挖矿

Yes, mining has become incredibly easier, no need for a miner, no need to turn on a professional configuration tool. Just turn on your PC or Mac, run The Market client application, and there you go! As long as you keep The Market client running in the background, it will keep digging digital coins. The achievement, named as Original Digital-Content Coin can be used to buy all your favorite digital contents.

是的，挖矿变得异常简单，不需要矿机，不需要开启专业的配置工具，打开你的PC或者Mac，运行我们的终端应用程序，就可以了！只要你保持The Market终端在后台运行，它就会一直挖币，得到的ODC（Original Digital-Content Coin）可以用来购买你喜欢的数字媒体内容了，就是这么简单！

Embedded Coin Market in The Client/终端内嵌市场交易

For example, maybe you are a loyal fan of American TV series, and you don't have enough ODC in hand to buy a newly released serial. No 
problem! In the embedded market of our client, you can directly purchase ODC from other users. It is entirely up to you and your counterpart to decide whether to trade with legal tender or other digital currencies such as BTC or ETH. The Market just provides a platform for matchmaking. By the way, ODC will be the first digital currency that can truly correspond to real-world value based on its nature of usage. Frequent transactions due to people's preference for digital contents can greatly increase the liquidity of ODC. We will leave the rest for your own imagination.

举个例子，也许你是个美剧死忠，追剧的时候你的ODC不够用了。这没问题！在我们终端内嵌的市场里面你可以直接向其他用户购买ODC，至于是用法币还是其它的数字货币来交易由你和你的交易对手方自由决定，The Market只是提供一个撮合交易的平台。顺便说一句，ODC将会是第一个真正能够对应价值的数字货币，由于人们对内容的喜好而产生的频繁交易，这样的交易可以极大的提升ODC的流动性，剩下的，还是作为我们留给你自己的想象空间吧！

How Many ODC Will be Issued/有多少ODC将被发行

The Market project will release up to 10 billion ODC tokens. In view of the future’s immeasurable copyrights of digital contents in The Market, we believe that 10 billion tokens is a very conservative number. Beside, we don't want ODC to become a subject of speculation, since which will increase a lot of uncertain factors for users and creators. 

整个The Market项目将面向全网发布100亿枚ODC代币，鉴于未来The Market集市上不可估量的版权数字内容，我们认为100亿枚代币是一个很保守的数字，因为我们不希望ODC变成被炒作的对象，这样对使用者以及发布者来说都会增加很多不确定因素。

These ODC will be mainly obtained by the users that continuously run The Market client through automatic mining process. The entire mining cycle is set to a ten-year period.

这些ODC将主要由开机并保持在线的The Market用户终端通过挖矿的手段获得。挖矿周期设定为十年。

The number of tokens generated by The Market Block chain system will be decreased by 20% per year. Namely, in the first year after lunch of The Market, there will be about 2.2 billion tokens being dug, and by the end of the 10th year, only 300 million tokens can be generated. After the one decade period ends, tokens can only be purchased from other uses. So early birds get more.

系统推出代币的数量将按照每年20%的速度递减，其中第一年整个矿池可以挖币的数量将是22亿左右，而第十年整个系统可以挖出的代币约为3亿个。当十年挖矿周期结束后，系统将不再产生新的代币，之后代币将只能通过市场交易获取。早起的鸟儿得到的更多，不是吗

Of course, like other Block chain application dev-teams, we have also kept a small proportion of original ODC tokens for ourselves. The purpose of doing so is to improve our living status and also to keep them as market stabilization funds. In the future, when the prices of ODC tokens fluctuate significantly, we will properly intervene in the market to ensure the stability of ODC values.

当然，像其它区块链应用开发团队一样，我们也为自己保留了很小比例的原始ODC代币，这样做的目的，第一是改善生活，第二是留作市场平准基金，在未来ODC代币价格严重波动的时候适当干预市场，保证价值稳定。

Who are We/我们是谁

Given The great potential of The Market for its ability of changing or even subverting the future, we chose to permanently remain anonymity, all you can find is only the few earliest ODC wallet addresses from the system.

鉴于The Market一旦上线后的巨大的潜在的颠覆性，我们选择永久匿名，你能看到的只有在这个系统里面最早上线的前几位的ODC钱包地址。
